 <h3>A little about me </h3>
 <p> My name is Brianna and im 14 years old. I'm a freshman at OHS. Im really into writing and art, but I just got into coding and I hope to get better at it. </p>

 <h3> What I love about tech </h3>
<p> I love that tech comes from imagination.Most times someone got a small idea and turned it into something big. Thats how apps like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter started. But then when you get into code you learn that there is so much behind thoes apps. The whole developing process and the time it takes to code every little thing is what makes me really love tech.  <P>

<h3> What I love about Code Next </h3>
<p> What I love about Code Next is that its all inclusive. They take the time to understand each indivudial person and bring people together by sharing everyones culture and making everyone feel welcome. But I love the way that they teach, they take things concepts and lessons that would be impossible to grasp and understand and then they break it down. They teach us so much and set us up with amazing oportunites in the future. </p>
